## About SWAGG

Unlike other cryptocurrencies, the swagg value is not based on speculation. We decided to have it as some kind of stable coin
with a 1:1 value. The cryptocurrency we will initially pair with is DOGE as its value is low and the transaction time is very fast.
Beign paired does not mean that the swagg will depend on the DOGE blockchain. Swagg is an independent cryptocurrency with its
own blockchain, security algorithm, consensus and coinbase.
